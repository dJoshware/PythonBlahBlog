                    My name is Josh Ellis, I'm 27, and I'm a self-taught software developer. I started learning code in the Spring of 2021 after the realization that everything around me was code. Just 0s and 1s. It was a revelation, honestly. From that point on, I knew I wanted to be a professional developer to be a part of the technological future. My sights were set on Web3/smart contract development but I knew I needed to start with the fundamentals. So, I enrolled in community college classes and began a Computer Information Technology - Programming concentration program while simultaneously finding online courses and tutorials for HTML, CSS, and Python.

                    Fast forward a few years and I've been in all corners of the internet learning new things, mastering old things, creating this and that, and I stay hungry for more. I've made terminal apps with Python and JavaScript, static web pages with HTML and CSS, dynamic web apps with Python and JavaScript using Node.js, React, and Flask, styled them with custom CSS, Bootstrap, and Tailwind, experimented with data manipulation, writing files, writing shell scripts to streamline processes or project creation, I have plans to completely automate some things in my house using custom home assistants, build a personal AI assistant that integrates with my home automation. Loads of different things. I can't help it, I think I'm a chronic learnerüòÅ

                    I'd love to change directions and do software development for a living, and while I'm grinding hard and trying to do so, I stay building and learning. I've gotten to the point where I'm ready/starting to learn about Web3/smart contract development and I'm so excited about it. I truly believe it's our world's future of not only finance but empowerment of the masses. Web1.0 was the read-only era (i.e. static web pages you could only visit/read), Web2.0 (current) is the read-write era (i.e. social media apps where users can write custom content that other users can read, any content transferred between users is typically private to only the involved users), and Web3.0 is, and will, be the read-write-own era (i.e. you can buy a product of some kind, that transaction is publicly "posted" to the blockchain where anyone in the world can view the transaction, which is otherwise called "proof-of-ownership", such that that product's ID is now associated with your wallet (or blockchain account) and now you own that product outright and no one can disprove it. In the real world, these concepts WILL apply to vehicle titles, registrations, home deeds, real estate contracts, government-issued IDs, money, betting platforms, subscription services, community centers, cities, states, and everything else you can think of.

                <p>
                    I'm very bullish on Web3.0 and that's what excites me the most about learning software development. I simply have too many ideas to just let go to waste, so I will take it upon myself to be a contributor to the future, whether I'm part of a team whose values align with mine, or if I go it alone. So, that's a little about my software development journey thus far. Aside from that, I'm married and I love to hang out with my wife. I've played guitar for about 14 years now and I enjoy jazz/fusion the most. I'm deeply inspired by Allan Holdsworth. I have one of his signature Kiesel models and it's a stunning piece of art. I also like to golf. I got into that in October of 2022. I've recently acquired the Callaway Paradigm AI Smoke 4-PW iron set and the Max driver.

                    Enough about me! I hope you enjoyed reading this and getting to know me. This blog app is not a production build. I will have a production version built with the MERN or PERN (PostgreSQL) stack soon, though. In my journey, I've taken a liking to Node.js, Express.js, React, and JavaScript in general for web development as it's obviously more natural for that. I have been using Python and Flask for the last couple of years and I just think I've grown out of it.
